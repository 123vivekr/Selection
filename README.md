# Welcome!

#### Who are we?

FOSS MEC consists of a group of bright individuals from all different fields who came together to bring forward tech and Open Source Software at MEC. From people who are working on Government funded Machine Learning Projects to doing Summer of code with Google, to people having their own start-ups and Mentoring in Google Code-In, our club has become a hub of knowledge working for the common goal of bringing forth the importance of Open Source in our college, which is all happening by people volunteering.

#### Humble Beginning.

As the most young club at MEC, only 6 months old, we have considerable achievments even though we are a quite young club. From teaching over 70 people to use Git and Github, and conducting an Ethical Hacking workshop by bring the renowned team Bi0s into the college, and taking over college projects to be done using Open Source, we have quite a few acheivements to boast about and we don't plan to stop.

#### Okay, cool! But how do I get in?

So coming back to our point of this article. Last year when we began, we had no organised way to select people, we had to manually select the best people from over 200 tech oriented people. We needed determined people who were willing to work for this organisation with their heart and soul. We needed people who were passionate about learning and who were willing to volunteer for Open Source. We needed smart, young minds who were keen on learning and who were always looking for oppertunities to move ahead. 

This article is actually a tutorial for selecting a 10-20 able, working students from a pool of over 300 students. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with anything, if you are ready to work for Open Source, you'll have all the oppertunities in the world open for you and people ready to mentor and guide you to achieve it.

#### What can Open Source offer me?

What do you want? Working for Open Source will make your resume stand out when applying for a job. It'll without no doubt give a boost to your career.

Work? Working for Open Source organisation can sometimes even land you in a job. If you start contributing to Open Source Organisations, and if you're a good enough developer it can land you in a job, even before your final year. And you don't have to be programmer, if you're good with content writing and a good manager, it could also get you in.

Money? Have you heard of Google Summer of Code? Working for Open Source Organisation for a mere 60 days can get you a sum of Rs. 2,00,000. Over 1200 students participate out of which 600 students are from India and there had been GSoC Students from MEC in the past, working for reputed Organisations like Debian and Fedora, which FOSSMEC can get you in touch with. There had been a Ex-MECian, who participated in Google Summer of Code for all of his four years, and when the stipend was Rs 3,50,000. So just imagine four years!! That's 4 X 3,50,000 that's approximately Rs 14,00,000 from working a few months for different Open Source Organisation during college!!!
So first year is not too early to start. Okay, so know the importance of Open Source now? Let's go!
